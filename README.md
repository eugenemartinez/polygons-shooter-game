## About the Project  

**Polygons Survivor** is a little game I built to explore game development with Phaser 3. The concept is simple—you're a polygon trying to survive in a world of hostile shapes. The more complex the enemy shape (more sides), the more difficult it becomes.

## Features  

- **Shape-based Gameplay**: The enemy polygon's number of sides affects the speed, and health.  
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Enemies get tougher and more numerous the longer you survive.  
- **Boss Encounters**: Face special larger enemies at intervals.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile/tablet devices.  
- **Auto-aim for Mobile**: Touch devices get auto-aim functionality for easier play.  

## How to Play  

- **Survive**: Avoid enemy polygons while shooting them down.  
- **Score Points**: Destroy enemies to increase your score.  
- **Last as Long as Possible**: Your survival time is tracked.
